# Serialization

Data serialization is a core feature for any API library/framework.  
In fact data retrieved from database should be transformed and encoded in a machine-readable format (ex: json or xml).

Unlike other REST API libraries and frameworks, Solido is not tied to a single serializer library.  
It instead provides an interface and adapters for three (at the moment) serializers in [serialization component](./serialization-component.md?id=serialization)
